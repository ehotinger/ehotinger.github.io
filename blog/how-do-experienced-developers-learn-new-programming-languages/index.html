                <h1 id="how-do-experienced-programmers-learn-a-new-programming-language">How do experienced programmers learn a new programming language?</h1>
<p>I recently read through <a href="#citations">[1] - Here we go again: why is it difficult
for developers to learn another programming language?</a>. In
this paper, they interviewed a large sample size of experienced
developers and asked them various questions about how they learn a new
programming language. Some of the takeaways and trends were pretty
interesting (in <strong>bold</strong> below).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Programmers learned languages on their own</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, once you graduate university, chances are you won&rsquo;t ever take
a class to learn a new programming language again. Any time I want to
learn a new language, I try to go through the basic playgrounds and
use it. I try to identify concepts that are fundamentally different in
this language compared to other languages I&rsquo;ve used in the past, so I
can restructure my thought process when using the language. Books and
documentation can help you prioritize education for certain aspects of
a programming language.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Just-in-time learning is a dominant strategy</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Experienced developers tend to be naturally older and I think this
boils down to prioritization. Once you&rsquo;ve experienced 10 languages, it
doesn&rsquo;t feel like investing a ton of energy into a new shiny thing
will be as worthwhile when you&rsquo;re far along in your career. Over time,
shiny things lose their glamor. These folks will tend to be technical
leaders and have many other responsibilities beyond learning a new
language and writing code in it, meaning they usually get even less
time to play and experiment in their day-to-day jobs.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Learning a language is difficult when there is little to no
mapping with previous languages</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Absolutely. Jumping from a language like Java or C# to Haskell is
extremely difficult. You have to be careful to not fall into traps
using your past knowledge. Learning to unlearn is a skill.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Mindshifts are required when switching paradigms</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Same as the above point really.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Searching for the right terminology and code examples is difficult</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>For new or esoteric languages that&rsquo;s generally true, but I&rsquo;m a bit
surprised by this one. If you&rsquo;re learning a new language at a job,
chances are the language is well-known, well-document, and
well-supported. Are you experimenting in production and likely making
the technology less maintainable for the business long-term? :)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Retooling is a necessary and challenging first step</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, being efficient in a particular IDE is one of the things that
make a standout developer in terms of throughput. It takes a lot of
time to relearn all the keybinds across different IDEs, and that&rsquo;s why
a lot of folks stick with vim or emacs for a lot of their code
development through the years.</li>
</ul>
