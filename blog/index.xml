      <description>Optimizing Impact and the Realities of Principal Engineering The problem with being a Principal Engineer is the number of opportunities. There are so many teams that need help, so which door do you go through? You have to say no or you&amp;rsquo;re going to fail. Pick the things you&amp;rsquo;re not going to do.&#xA;We often talk about the fear of missing out - but as a PE, you are doomed to the certainty of missing out.</description>

      <description>Self Discovery and Career Growth to Principal Engineering A lot of people get promoted to senior engineer, and then they ask how to go to principal. This is not how it works. For any promotion, I tell people not to worry about immediately figuring out how to get to the next level, but especially as a senior engineer. Just focus on being a really great senior engineer first. Be great at whatever level you’re currently at.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Principal and Staff Engineering As a principal engineer (PE), you’ll find out that your whispers become roars. Casual comments you make in meetings will magically transform into roadmap items. Suddenly, you have a megaphone that you’re speaking out of at all times. Many PEs are stunned at how much people believe in their ideas and how much faith they have in them.&#xA;In the last year, I saw a story from a newly minted PE.</description>

      <description>AWS Lambda Response Streaming Overview In April 2023, AWS Lambda made an exciting announcement and released response streaming which makes it one of the first function providers to offer streaming support in the world. Before, Lambda-based applications had to use a traditional request-response model which meant applications had to fully generate and buffer responses before returning anything to a client.&#xA;Response Streaming is a new invocation pattern:&#xA;There is an InvokeWithResponseStream API and a new handler signature for applications.</description>

      <description>Why Quality &amp;amp; Assurance Teams are Not Enough: Engineers Must Take Responsibility Engineers must own the quality of the code that they write. Typical quality &amp;amp; assurance teams do not reinforce correct ownership.&#xA;As engineers, our job is to push for quality. We&amp;rsquo;re the only ones that are close enough to the code to understand the shortcuts we&amp;rsquo;re taking, what problems we&amp;rsquo;re creating for the future, and what issues may happen down the road as a result of our actions.</description>

      <description>How do experienced programmers learn a new programming language? I recently read through [1] - Here we go again: why is it difficult for developers to learn another programming language?. In this paper, they interviewed a large sample size of experienced developers and asked them various questions about how they learn a new programming language. Some of the takeaways and trends were pretty interesting (in bold below).&#xA;Programmers learned languages on their own Yeah, once you graduate university, chances are you won&amp;rsquo;t ever take a class to learn a new programming language again.</description>

      <description>Practical Developer Productivity Developer productivity has been studied extensively across the last few decades because developers are typically the most expensive piece of software development. Despite decades of research, nobody has cracked the case. Moreover, most teams struggle to come up with a metric or goal to even define what it means to capture &amp;ldquo;developer productivity.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Over the last few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a significant amount of energy in the space of developer productivity for an organization of ~500 developers.</description>

      <description>Grey Modes In complex distributed systems, hardware failure is inevitable. The ability to operate in a grey mode (a mode in which a system is partially working) is an important and deliberate architectural choice to consider. Ask yourself the following question: would customers be more upset to have a completely nonfunctional system, or have a subset of the functionality working? For example, if you are working on a storage layer, perhaps it would be better to serve reads even though you can&amp;rsquo;t serve writes at the same time.</description>

      <guid>https://ehotinger.com/blog/the-most-important-software-documentation/</guid>
      <description>The most important documentation in software engineering is the rationale behind architectural decisions and critical components. This rationale is should be discussed and recorded in a document via design meetings. The design document should contain architectural options which list off pros/cons. The document should have an opinion on the preferred approach and tell the reader why it is the preferred approach.&#xA;Ideally, the design discussions are also recorded and any feedback is persisted into the architectural design document.</description>

      <description>System Design Interviews: Framework and Strategy System design interviews are often the most difficult technical interviews and can be daunting to tackle. They require a candidate to gather requirements, deal with ambiguity, communicate, and optimize their solution using all of their computer science knowledge. To make matters worse, these interviews are open-ended with hundreds of potential variations to achieve the desired end state of a system. How could anyone expect someone to design such a complex system in only an hour of time?</description>

      <description>Availability Numbers Every Programmer Should Know Availability refers to the amount of continuous uptime of a service. This is measured in a percentage, where 100% means a service has zero downtime and 0% means the service is never operational.&#xA;A service level agreement (SLA) is a commitment from a provider to a customer. When SLAs are mentioned for availability, providers will be stating their commitment to the uptime of the system, after which you are usually entitled to some form of compensation.</description>

You ignore the fiery hell you are in. It becomes tolerable; a mild nuisance.&#xA;Take all of the negativity and use it to shield others.

They had dozens of patents, scientific papers, and a work history nothing short of genius. They built tools and languages I used on a daily basis. They were a true prodigy and I could not believe I had the privilege of working under them.</description>

      <description>Every developer should have a To, CC, and Other folder in Outlook.&#xA;You should have 3 main rules in order from most to least important:&#xA;Anything sent to me as a To goes to the To folder Anything sent to me as a CC goes to the CC folder Anything else gets sent to the Other folder. You should never look at your original Inbox folder from this point on.</description>

      <description>This is how I set up my blog which uses GitHub pages to have a custom domain and SSL all on AWS for $12/year &amp;ndash; just the cost of the .com. The other services are all in the free-tier.&#xA;Register your domain Use Route 53: https://aws.amazon.com/route53/&#xA;All you have to do here is go through the Register Domain workflow that Amazon has created. It&amp;rsquo;ll allow you to buy a domain name of your choice for about $12 (for a .</description>

      <title>ACR Tasks Image Vulnerability Scanning</title>

      <description>In this blog you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to set up vulnerability scanning for all of your container images using Azure Container Registry Tasks and Aqua&amp;rsquo;s microscanner. By the end, you&amp;rsquo;ll know how to create a relatively complex workflow which prevents your images getting pushed to a container registry if they have vulnerabilities found during build time, preventing the distribution of them entirely.&#xA;This is generic, so you can bring whatever image scanner you prefer.</description>

      <description>Azure Container Registry Tasks came out with a lot of new features in the last year. Many people don&amp;rsquo;t realize the insane potential of this service, so I wanted to share a few things that you probably didn&amp;rsquo;t know and some of the things the team has been working on.&#xA;In particular, I wanted to use one of the most common feature requests of the Azure Container Registry - automatic garbage collection of old or unused tags/manifests/images - as an example of how you can make the world your oyster using ACR Tasks.</description>

      <title>Bypassing the character limit displayed when debugging with Delve and VSCode</title>

      <description>Debugging Go applications with Visual Studio Code and Delve is extremely powerful. However, there are some default settings which you may want to tweak to improve this experience and they&amp;rsquo;re not straightforward to find out.&#xA;Sometimes when you&amp;rsquo;re debugging if a variable&amp;rsquo;s value is really long, i.e. more than 64 characters, you&amp;rsquo;ll see the value&amp;rsquo;s content end as &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;+7 more&amp;rdquo; or however many characters were truncated. To get around this, you need to customize your workspace or user settings in Visual Studio Code.</description>

      <title>Installing Go on Windows (including Make)</title>
      <link>https://ehotinger.com/blog/installing-go-windows/</link>

      <description>This is an extremely brief guide to setting up Go on Windows. There are plenty of guides out there for setting up Go, but none that also include how to get your Makefiles working cross-platform easily. The easiest way I&amp;rsquo;ve found to do this is to change shells. This is especially true if you have Makefiles like I do, where $(shell) is everywhere. With the default shell you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with CREATE PROCESS(NULL, .</description>

      <title>Making a Github Pages Hugo Blog</title>
      <link>https://ehotinger.com/blog/making-a-github-pages-hugo-blog/</link>

      <description>This is a quick-start guide to setting up Hugo with GitHub pages, since it took too much effort to find the full instructions anywhere else. It should hopefully take you ~15 minutes to complete the entire thing.&#xA;Make two GitHub repositories, i.e., https://github.com/ehotinger/blog and https://github.com/ehotinger/ehotinger.github.io - the first repository is for the unrendered Hugo content, and the second is for the rendered content. Note: you could just have one repository as your GitHub page, but this approach allows you to easily switch off GitHub pages if you want to.</description>
