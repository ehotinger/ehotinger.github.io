                <h1 id="behavioral-interviews-framework-and-strategy">Behavioral Interviews: Framework and Strategy</h1>
<h2 id="1-the-framework">1. The Framework</h2>
<p>Use the Situation, Task, Action, Result framework. Also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result">STAR</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Situation:</strong> The interviewer wants you to present a recent challenging situation in which you found yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Task:</strong> What were you required to achieve? The interviewer will be looking to see what you were trying to achieve from the situation.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> What did you do? The interviewer will be looking for information on what you did, why you did it and what the alternatives were.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> What was the outcome of your actions? What did you achieve through your actions? Did you meet your goal? What did you learn? Have you used that learning since?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2-tips">2. Tips</h2>
<ol>
<li>Come up with a pre-existing set of situations, tasks, actions, and results that are the most impactful and rehearse these before the interview.</li>
<li>When providing answers, talk about impact/depth/scope/breadth/complexity/ambiguity/influence. These dimensions show the overall depth and exposure to situations for higher level roles.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="3-example-questions">3. Example questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tell me about a time when you had no idea about the solution to a problem and you had to go and learn a bunch of new information to figure it out.</li>
<li>What is the coolest thing you&rsquo;ve ever learned that made you better at your job?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-example-of-different-responses-according-to">4. Example of different responses according to</h2>
<p>The aforementioned dimensions (impact/depth/scope/breadth/complexity/ambiguity/influence) are the main differentiators when it comes to selecting a candidate for a particular role. If you are applying for a senior role, it&rsquo;s important to stress these dimensions in your response.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example of how a recent graduate may respond vs. a staff engineer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Tell me about a time you had to solve a difficult problem.</li>
<li><strong>Answer (as a New Grad):</strong> I was assigned a task that I didn&rsquo;t know how to do. I asked my tech lead for guidance, did some reading on wiki pages and Stack Overflow, wrote a proof of concept that demonstrated I could solve the problem, and then I delivered the solution.</li>
<li><strong>Answer (as a Staff Engineer):</strong> I was looking into how we could expand the product&rsquo;s feature set to include governance. I spent several days researching our competitors and reading recent white papers to learn about innovation in the area. Eventually, I came up with a new idea that I believed was compelling. I spent time validating its purpose with customers, wrote a PRFAQ that our leadership agreed to, and built the team from the ground up to solve it. From a technical perspective, it was difficult because XX isn&rsquo;t a well understood or solved problem in the industry and we had to make tradeoffs like YY. It took 30 engineers a year to build the feature, which has now become a critical vertical in our business.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can tell, the second answer to the same question has significantly more ambiguity, complexity, scope, impact, depth, and influence.</p>
<h2 id="5-inspiration">5. Inspiration</h2>
<p>Read the mission statement of the company you&rsquo;re interviewing for and make up questions that are relevant to their principles. For example, you can use <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles">Amazon&rsquo;s leadership principles</a> and make up questions that are relevant to each leadership principle. Every company will ask similar questions so this is a good starting point.</p>
