                <h1 id="introduction-to-principal-and-staff-engineering">Introduction to Principal and Staff Engineering</h1>
<p>As a principal engineer (PE), you’ll find out that your whispers become roars. Casual comments you make in meetings will magically transform into roadmap items. Suddenly, you have a megaphone that you’re speaking out of at all times. Many PEs are stunned at how much people believe in their ideas and how much faith they have in them.</p>
<p>In the last year, I saw a story from a newly minted PE. He filed a ticket to a sub-team in his organization with the intent to brainstorm a solution to a problem in the future. He woke up the next day, and to his surprise, he saw comments on the ticket that a design was made, and a code review was sent out for the issue. I found this fascinating and hysterical because of the impact PEs can have with such minor comments. And what was even funnier was we all started to ask him to file tickets to our teams so that hopefully work we needed would get done just as quickly.</p>
<p>In order to get promoted to PE, it generally takes about 1-2 years once you have a clearly defined principal-scoped project. And the responsibilities are completely different than a typical senior SDE. Most of the skills here have nothing to do directly with a specific technology. It’s almost like a brand new role. And because the promotion process is so difficult, switching teams, jobs, or positions usually means you will reset or delay this process.</p>
<p>The below role overview lists some of the key responsibilities and differences between a senior SDE, but I want to call special attention to some of the words in bold. Take time to read these differences and compare them to your responsibilities as a senior engineer.</p>
<h2 id="role-overview">Role Overview</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Completely independent</strong>, requires close to zero supervision. Capable of taking entire products without definition, providing clarity, and delivering them.</li>
<li><strong>Leads multiple teams.</strong> Typically a site lead/complete expert in an area.</li>
<li>Works closely with customers. Is an <strong>advocate for the product and business.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Strategical</strong> and sometimes tactical. Thinks about the <strong>broader product, not just projects and tasks.</strong></li>

<li>Owns <strong>organization-level architecture/product solutions.</strong> Influences technology direction for organization.</li>

<p>Amazon principal engineers have a unique set of tenets which go beyond the standard <a href="https://amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles">leadership principles</a>. You can find these by searching for Amazon’s PE tenets or <a href="https://amazon.jobs/en/internal/landing_pages/pe-community-tenets">clicking here</a>. These tenets are great to apply to any job.
