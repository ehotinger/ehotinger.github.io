                <p>I frequently get asked what books helped me grow the most. What would you recommend that I read to get superpowers? How did you learn about that one algorithm or data structure? How did you learn so much about <em>something</em> for work?</p>
<p>The truth is, the books and experiences that I feel like helped me the most, have nothing to do with my job. I&rsquo;ll recommend those below, in a stack-ranked list and I&rsquo;ll also recommend the books I think helped me learn to be technical.</p>
<p>Everyone struggles at different aspects of life. Some people need to read a ton about a domain before it clicks, others need to learn about leadership, discipline, psychology, stress, anxiety, and more. You need to identify your weaknesses and formulate a plan to improve it slowly every day. More importantly, you need to understand what areas you&rsquo;re amazing at and accelerate your growth in those areas. Go all in on what works for you and let it define you. Embrace it. Don&rsquo;t worry about people judging you.</p>
<p>Incremental progress, even if it is 0.0001% each day is progress. Overnight success is not a thing; it appears like that to other people after countless days of small progressions.</p>
<p>I grew up in the middle of nowhere in trailer parks, abuse, and drugs. I was the first person in my family to go to college. I didn&rsquo;t have serious mentors until late high school, and for the people who helped steer me in a positive direction, I am indefinitely grateful. A lot of people say I am a natural leader and I am an outgoing person, but the truth is I am absolutely nothing like that. I had crippling anxiety, depression, and panic attacks for more than 3 years of my life. I studied psychology and mental health for three years to help me deal with my own personal trauma. I am extremely fortunate and grateful to be where I am in life because the odds were against me.</p>
<p>When I was around 13, I watched two interviews about a couple of brothers and their past. One brother was a successful doctor. He was happily married with kids and a family. The other brother was in jail after multiple felonies. When they interviewed the brother in jail, he spoke about how his father was a drug dealer, murderer, and more. When they asked how he ended up there, the brother said, &ldquo;how could I end up any differently?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second interview totally changed my perspective. They asked the same questions to the doctor. Similarly, he said &ldquo;my father was a drug dealer, murderer, and more. How could I end up any differently?&rdquo; This perception radically changed how I viewed life. Rather than using adversity as an excuse, they used it as as kindling for their soul. By my standards, the most successful, diverse, and kind people in the world have always dealt with significant adversity and it defines how they interact with people every day.</p>
<p>Now that you know a bit about me and my weaknesses, here are some of the books I&rsquo;ve enjoyed:</p>
<h2 id="psychology">Psychology</h2>
<ul>
<li>Anything by Dr. David Burns. For example, <a href="https://amzn.to/3g4VhLo">Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy</a>. I listened to the entire <a href="https://feelinggood.com/list-of-feeling-good-podcasts/">Feeling Good Podcast</a>.</li>
<li>Anything by Thich Nhat Hanh. For example, <a href="https://amzn.to/3g0uzTV">No Mud, No Lotus: The Art of Transforming Suffering</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3iO4rhe">Metacognitive Therapy for Anxiety and Depression</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3jVxMp5">Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning</a></li>
<li>I also highly recommend workbooks for anxiety, depression, and more if you need them: <a href="https://amzn.to/2VUbOui">The Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Workbook for Panic Attacks</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3spBX0f">Panic Attacks Workbook: A Guided Program for Beating the Panic Trick</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="leadership-and-discipline">Leadership and Discipline</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3AFqBrZ">Can&rsquo;t Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3AFqpZN">Embrace the Suck: The Navy SEAL Way to an Extraordinary Life</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3xNID9t">Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3m4T0DC">The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="computer-science">Computer science</h2>
<p>The best way to learn how to write perfect code is to read a lot of it. Read the source code of Go, C#, Java, Python, etc. I read the entire C# and Go source code libraries and made contributions to both. Don&rsquo;t just use frameworks to build different things, read them and write them. There&rsquo;s no shortcut here, it takes a lot of time and effort. Find something you&rsquo;re interested in and make incremental progress each day. Don&rsquo;t be frustrated if you are slow, remember the 0.0001% rule.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I exclusively read source code and white papers. Books are generally not useful because they are published too late, or published by people who are not the original authors of the code. Here are a few recommendations, but they are more related to design/code quality/interviewing. If you want to get seriously good at coding, go as deep as you possibly can and make contributions to core projects. Read white papers 10+ times until you understand them. You can choose those papers based on your interests (i.e., Lamport logical clocks, HDFS, Map Reduce, Linux file systems, etc.).</p>
