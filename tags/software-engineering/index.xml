      <description>Why Quality &amp;amp; Assurance Teams are Not Enough: Engineers Must Take Responsibility Engineers must own the quality of the code that they write. Typical quality &amp;amp; assurance teams do not reinforce correct ownership.
As engineers, our job is to push for quality. We&amp;rsquo;re the only ones that are close enough to the code to understand the shortcuts we&amp;rsquo;re taking, what problems we&amp;rsquo;re creating for the future, and what issues may happen down the road as a result of our actions.</description>

      <description>The most important documentation in software engineering is the rationale behind architectural decisions and critical components. This rationale is should be discussed and recorded in a document via design meetings. The design document should contain architectural options which list off pros/cons. The document should have an opinion on the preferred approach and tell the reader why it is the preferred approach.
Ideally, the design discussions are also recorded and any feedback is persisted into the architectural design document.</description>
