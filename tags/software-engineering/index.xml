      <description>Technical Program Manager (TPM) Example Interview Questions Below is a collection of various interview questions I&amp;rsquo;ve asked to TPMs in the past along with an example calibration guideline you can use.
Technical Problem Solving Can you give me an example where you had to dive deep into a problem and be hands on with the engineering team to figure out a solution to a problem? How would you run a project to upgrade users to a new version of an API?</description>

      <title>Engineers Must Own Quality</title>

      <description>Why Quality &amp;amp; Assurance Teams are Not Enough: Engineers Must Take Responsibility Engineers must own the quality of the code that they write. Typical quality &amp;amp; assurance teams do not reinforce correct ownership.
As engineers, our job is to push for quality. We&amp;rsquo;re the only ones that are close enough to the code to understand the shortcuts we&amp;rsquo;re taking, what problems we&amp;rsquo;re creating for the future, and what issues may happen down the road as a result of our actions.</description>

      <description>The most important documentation in software engineering is the rationale behind architectural decisions and critical components. This rationale is should be discussed and recorded in a document via design meetings. The design document should contain architectural options which list off pros/cons. The document should have an opinion on the preferred approach and tell the reader why it is the preferred approach.
Ideally, the design discussions are also recorded and any feedback is persisted into the architectural design document.</description>
