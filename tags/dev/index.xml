      <title>Operating in Grey Modes</title>

      <description>Grey Modes In complex distributed systems, hardware failure is inevitable. The ability to operate in a grey mode (a mode in which a system is partially working) is an important and deliberate architectural choice to consider. Ask yourself the following question: would customers be more upset to have a completely nonfunctional system, or have a subset of the functionality working? For example, if you are working on a storage layer, perhaps it would be better to serve reads even though you can&amp;rsquo;t serve writes at the same time.</description>

      <title>The Most Important Software Documentation</title>

      <description>The most important documentation in software engineering is the rationale behind architectural decisions and critical components. This rationale is should be discussed and recorded in a document via design meetings. The design document should contain architectural options which list off pros/cons. The document should have an opinion on the preferred approach and tell the reader why it is the preferred approach.
Ideally, the design discussions are also recorded and any feedback is persisted into the architectural design document.</description>

      <description>A common question from junior engineers is: &amp;ldquo;how long should I wait before I ask for help?&amp;rdquo; The below post will offer guidance for junior engineers on when and how to ask effective questions. We&amp;rsquo;ll also cover guidance to senior engineers on how to answer questions from junior engineers.
This post offers advice from both sides of the coin to help provide you the perspective of your fellow engineers. Remember: you were once a junior engineer and one day you will be the senior engineer!</description>

      <description>Behavioral Interviews: Framework and Strategy This post is the final framework and strategy for technical interviews. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, be sure to check out my similar posts on System Design Interviews and Coding Interviews too.
1. The Framework Use the Situation, Task, Action, Result framework. Also known as STAR.
Situation: The interviewer wants you to present a recent challenging situation in which you found yourself. Task: What were you required to achieve?</description>

      <description>Coding Interviews: Framework and Strategy The goal of this post is to provide you with a reliable strategy and framework for general coding and technical interviews. At the end, I provide a rough calibration guide to be used in any coding interview so that you can evaluate your performance and others&amp;rsquo; performance with mock practice once you understand the framework and strategies.
The Framework Every coding interview can be broken into four high-level steps:</description>

      <description>A few common problems that I hit when installing WSL. This is my personal mini guide to get it up and running in a few minutes.
First, you can visit https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#simplified-installation-for-windows-insiders to get a beta build and run the commands to install WSL.
WSL can fail on a new machine even after this because it relies on virtualization:
Enable Hyper-V (Turn Windows features on or off -&amp;gt; Hyper-V) Enable virtualization in the BIOS (go to your CPU Config and you&amp;rsquo;ll find it) Bonus oddities:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve created something magical: an invisible compass. The product is not astonishing; it&amp;rsquo;s fragile and young, yet blissful. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t been announced yet, but it will be later this year. I hope you will find it equally mesmerizing.
For the last six months, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked tirelessly to offer a chance for it to succeed. It&amp;rsquo;s not my own company and I&amp;rsquo;m not getting paid some exuberant amount of money to stay committed to an arbitrary mission.</description>

      <title>ACR Tasks Image Vulnerability Scanning</title>
      <link>https://ehotinger.com/blog/acr-tasks-image-scanning/</link>

      <description>In this blog you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to set up vulnerability scanning for all of your container images using Azure Container Registry Tasks and Aqua&amp;rsquo;s microscanner. By the end, you&amp;rsquo;ll know how to create a relatively complex workflow which prevents your images getting pushed to a container registry if they have vulnerabilities found during build time, preventing the distribution of them entirely.
This is generic, so you can bring whatever image scanner you prefer.</description>

      <title>Bypassing the character limit displayed when debugging with Delve and VSCode</title>

      <description>Debugging Go applications with Visual Studio Code and Delve is extremely powerful. However, there are some default settings which you may want to tweak to improve this experience and they&amp;rsquo;re not straightforward to find out.
Sometimes when you&amp;rsquo;re debugging if a variable&amp;rsquo;s value is really long, i.e. more than 64 characters, you&amp;rsquo;ll see the value&amp;rsquo;s content end as &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;+7 more&amp;rdquo; or however many characters were truncated. To get around this, you need to customize your workspace or user settings in Visual Studio Code.</description>

      <title>Installing Go on Windows (including Make)</title>
      <link>https://ehotinger.com/blog/installing-go-windows/</link>

      <description>This is an extremely brief guide to setting up Go on Windows. There are plenty of guides out there for setting up Go, but none that also include how to get your Makefiles working cross-platform easily. The easiest way I&amp;rsquo;ve found to do this is to change shells. This is especially true if you have Makefiles like I do, where $(shell) is everywhere. With the default shell you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with CREATE PROCESS(NULL, .</description>

      <title>Installing Hugo</title>

      <description>This is a quick-start guide to setting up Hugo with GitHub pages, since it took too much effort to find the full instructions anywhere else. It should hopefully take you ~15 minutes to complete the entire thing.
Make two GitHub repositories, i.e., https://github.com/ehotinger/blog and https://github.com/ehotinger/ehotinger.github.io - the first repository is for the unrendered Hugo content, and the second is for the rendered content. Note: you could just have one repository as your GitHub page, but this approach allows you to easily switch off GitHub pages if you want to.</description>
