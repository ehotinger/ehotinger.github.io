      <description>Optimizing Impact and the Realities of Principal Engineering The problem with being a Principal Engineer is the number of opportunities. There are so many teams that need help, so which door do you go through? You have to say no or you&amp;rsquo;re going to fail. Pick the things you&amp;rsquo;re not going to do.
We often talk about the fear of missing out - but as a PE, you are doomed to the certainty of missing out.</description>

      <description>Self Discovery and Career Growth to Principal Engineering A lot of people get promoted to senior engineer, and then they ask how to go to principal. This is not how it works. For any promotion, I tell people not to worry about immediately figuring out how to get to the next level, but especially as a senior engineer. Just focus on being a really great senior engineer first. Be great at whatever level you’re currently at.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Principal and Staff Engineering As a principal engineer (PE), you’ll find out that your whispers become roars. Casual comments you make in meetings will magically transform into roadmap items. Suddenly, you have a megaphone that you’re speaking out of at all times. Many PEs are stunned at how much people believe in their ideas and how much faith they have in them.
In the last year, I saw a story from a newly minted PE.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve created something magical: an invisible compass. The product is not astonishing; it&amp;rsquo;s fragile and young, yet blissful. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t been announced yet, but it will be later this year. I hope you will find it equally mesmerizing.
For the last six months, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked tirelessly to offer a chance for it to succeed. It&amp;rsquo;s not my own company and I&amp;rsquo;m not getting paid some exuberant amount of money to stay committed to an arbitrary mission.</description>

      <description>When you are in a living nightmare, the moment you start thinking of yourself instead of others, you have failed.
When you think of others, you stop focusing on yourself and your own desires. You ignore the fiery hell you are in. It becomes tolerable; a mild nuisance.
Take all of the negativity and use it to shield others. Pick up the torch and run as far and fast as you can.</description>

      <description>Many moons ago I met the best developer I have ever encountered. I was enamored by their ability to recall any piece of information that they have ever seen. They had dozens of patents, scientific papers, and a work history nothing short of genius. They built tools and languages I used on a daily basis. They were a true prodigy and I could not believe I had the privilege of working under them.</description>
