      <description>In this blog you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to set up vulnerability scanning for all of your container images using Azure Container Registry Tasks and Aqua&amp;rsquo;s microscanner. By the end, you&amp;rsquo;ll know how to create a relatively complex workflow which prevents your images getting pushed to a container registry if they have vulnerabilities found during build time, preventing the distribution of them entirely.
This is generic, so you can bring whatever image scanner you prefer.</description>

      <description>Azure Container Registry Tasks came out with a lot of new features in the last year. Many people don&amp;rsquo;t realize the insane potential of this service, so I wanted to share a few things that you probably didn&amp;rsquo;t know and some of the things the team has been working on.
In particular, I wanted to use one of the most common feature requests of the Azure Container Registry - automatic garbage collection of old or unused tags/manifests/images - as an example of how you can make the world your oyster using ACR Tasks.</description>
