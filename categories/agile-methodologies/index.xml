      <description>The most important documentation in software engineering is the rationale behind architectural decisions and critical components. This rationale is should be discussed and recorded in a document via design meetings. The design document should contain architectural options which list off pros/cons. The document should have an opinion on the preferred approach and tell the reader why it is the preferred approach.
Ideally, the design discussions are also recorded and any feedback is persisted into the architectural design document.</description>
