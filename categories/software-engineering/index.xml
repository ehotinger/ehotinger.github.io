      <description>System Design - Job Scheduler / Cluster Scheduling Design a cloud service where users can execute arbitrary jobs on a recurring schedule or manually.
Functional Requirements Users should be able to create/read/update/delete jobs and schedules A job is any arbitrary program/computation that a user writes. For example, I could write a program in Python that does print(&amp;quot;Hello World!&amp;quot;), or you could write one that downloads a file and uploads it into a blob storage service.</description>

      <description>Technical Program Manager (TPM) Example Interview Questions Below is a collection of various interview questions I&amp;rsquo;ve asked to TPMs in the past along with an example calibration guideline you can use.
Technical Problem Solving Can you give me an example where you had to dive deep into a problem and be hands on with the engineering team to figure out a solution to a problem? How would you run a project to upgrade users to a new version of an API?</description>

      <description>Optimizing Impact and the Realities of Principal Engineering The problem with being a Principal Engineer is the number of opportunities. There are so many teams that need help, so which door do you go through? You have to say no or you&amp;rsquo;re going to fail. Pick the things you&amp;rsquo;re not going to do.
We often talk about the fear of missing out - but as a PE, you are doomed to the certainty of missing out.</description>

      <description>Self Discovery and Career Growth to Principal Engineering A lot of people get promoted to senior engineer, and then they ask how to go to principal. This is not how it works. For any promotion, I tell people not to worry about immediately figuring out how to get to the next level, but especially as a senior engineer. Just focus on being a really great senior engineer first. Be great at whatever level you’re currently at.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Principal and Staff Engineering As a principal engineer (PE), you’ll find out that your whispers become roars. Casual comments you make in meetings will magically transform into roadmap items. Suddenly, you have a megaphone that you’re speaking out of at all times. Many PEs are stunned at how much people believe in their ideas and how much faith they have in them.
In the last year, I saw a story from a newly minted PE.</description>
